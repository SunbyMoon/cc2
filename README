copycat2--Normalizes targeted capture sequence coverage against a pooled normal control for CNV detection and plotting.  Uses variant allele frequecies to aid in normalization and provide support for CNV calls.
Required input files:
test_cov=case coverage, output from BEDTools coverage bed with target-level (exon or bait) read counts (should be in 7 column format obtained from using 3-col bed)
test_vcf=vcf for case (optional but strongly recommended)
ctl_info=list of control coverage files 1 file per line, with absolute file paths.  control coverage files should be in the same format as for cases.
target.bedfile=bedfile (3 column) used to create coverage files 

all other files are as described in R documentation.



Example:
library(CC2)
